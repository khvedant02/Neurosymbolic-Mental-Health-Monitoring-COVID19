# Neurosymbolic Mental Health Monitoring during COVID-19

Please note: The code with the dataset link will be updated by 16th September 2024. 

## Overview
This repository contains the source code and resources associated with our paper "A Domain-Agnostic Neurosymbolic Approach for Big Social Data Analysis: Evaluating Mental Health Sentiment on Social Media During COVID-19." The paper was submitted to IEEE Big Data and outlines a novel neurosymbolic AI method to monitor mental health sentiment on social media platforms like Twitter and Reddit during the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Repository Contents
- `src/`: Directory containing all the Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks used in our analysis.
- `data/`: Directory where the hydrated tweets are stored.
- `models/`: Pre-trained models and configurations used for sentiment analysis.
- `docs/`: Additional documentation and supplementary materials related to the project.

## Data Sharing
The tweet IDs and related datasets used in our study are available through an external data repository to comply with Twitter's data sharing policies. Researchers can access the data using the following link: [Access Tweet IDs and Datasets](https://example.com/dataset-link). You can use these IDs to hydrate the tweets using appropriate Twitter API tools for replication of our study or further analysis.

## Usage
To replicate the analysis or adapt the methodologies used in our study:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required Python libraries as listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Use the provided scripts in the `src/` directory to process the data and run the models.
